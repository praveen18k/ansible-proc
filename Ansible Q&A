Q - Push vs Pull ?
A - Pull mechanisam will have additional agent software.
  - In Pull there may not be change in configuration every time, chnage in configuration is very rare so wastage of data.
  - In Push additional agent is not required ansible server will push the configuration whenever new version updated.
Q - What is Ansible ?
A - Ansible provides open-source automation that reduces complexity and runs everywhere. Using Ansible lets you automate virtually any task. Here are some common use cases for Ansible:
      - Eliminate repetition and simplify workflows
      - Manage and maintain system configuration
      - Continuously deploy complex software
      - Perform zero-downtime rolling updates
    Ansible uses simple, human-readable scripts called playbooks to automate your tasks. You declare the desired state of a local or remote system in your playbook. Ansible ensures that the system remains in that state.
Q - What is inventory ?
A - Inventory is list of hosts your ansible server is managing.
Q - What is Adhoc commands in Ansible ?
A - Ansible adhoc command is generallay command line option to do somthing in the ansible hosts in emergency cases.
A - Adhoc commands are emergency commands, if we want to login and perform action in server without login, we can use adhoc commands.
  - Ex: To install and start nginx without login to server.
    CMD: $ ansible -i inventory mongodb (name of the inventory) --become(execution access) -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ansible.builtin.yum -a "name=nginx state=installed"
    CMD: $ ansible -i inventory mongodb --become -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ansible.builtin.service -a "name=nginx state=started"
Q - What are playbooks ?
A - In playbook we keep all ansible modules/collections in a YAML file and run that file
Q - What is configuration Management?
A - 
Q - Do you think Ansible is better than other configuration management tools? If yes, Why?
A - Ansible is different from other configuration management tools and it is better in achiving a specific use case :
  - Lets assume ansible is agent less, if you want to configure 100s of VMs or any servers, you dont have to install any agnet when you are using ansible as a configuration management tool. other configuration tolls have like master slave architecture becaue of these you have to pre configure all of these VMs. But in ansible case you have to have a password less authentication between host that ansible installed and the other servers which which you want to configure with ansible.
Q - Can you write an asnible Playbook to install httpd service and get it running ?
A - 
Q - How Ansible helped your organization ?
A - We have 40 servers previously we used basic shell script to install some packages weather it be basic security patching as it is mandatory installation required by my organization, turning of firewall on all the VMs, and enabling strict rules.
